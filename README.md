#Topics in Risk Management - Final Project Repository
This repository contains all the code used in my final project of the "Topics in Risk Management" course at McMaster university. The project simulates a portfolio and its risk measures (notable VaR and cVaR) following a CreditMetrics like model. 

## TODO
The code in the repository is well commented and documented. I may do some refactoring in the future, but I'm happy to leave the project be for now.
